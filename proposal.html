            <h2>App Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    On our app users will be interacting with their personally uploaded data about 
                    their habits. Our app will allow for the addition of that information 
                    as well as have a dashboard to access a summary of their progress on keeping up 
                    with these habits. Our app would synthesize the daily information into forms 
                    generally useful to our users; for instance into weekly/monthly charts or statistics including 
                    average time spent on any certain habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we identified a problem, the lack of an approachable habit tracker apps especially 
                    in the context of medical treatment. Our app aims to address said issue by providing a very 
                    flexible but still attractive app for housing all of your habit information. Our app 
                    will be a low stakes affair allowing people to add however much or however little 
                    information they want to everyday without penalty. Our app will support a person's existing 
                    intrinsic motivation to better themselves, and create a space for self-organization 
                    which is especially desired with an audience of patients.
