                    Being able to manage one’s health can become a daunting task nowadays. 
                    We usually rely on hospitals and clinics to manage our health records and those 
                    sometimes are not shared across these different institutions. We believe that 
                    patients should have control over their health record, however, there is a gap 
                    that exists between health institutions and its patients. Yes, there are 
                    solutions that already exist that are provided by health institutions, however 
                    we have found that a common problem across these is that they are under 
                    utilized because they are complex, not user-friendly, and often unengaging. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is crucial to manage one’s health, but it is difficult with the portals and 
                    apps that exist to maintain that self engagement and accountability 
                    in our own health. These lack personalization, or overall lack a good interface. 
                    Our proposed web app will aim to bridge this gap by offering a personalized 
                    experience through an initial quiz to understand user’s preferences and even 
                    treatment needs, along with features that will allow for the categorization of 
                    their habits in a user-friendly manner. Users will also be able to journal 
                    and their experiences. All of this seeks to make a significant difference in the 
                    lives of those striving to manage their health in a more effective way.

            <h2>App Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    On our app users will be interacting with their personally uploaded data about 
                    their habits. Our app will allow for the addition of that information 
                    as well as have a dashboard to access a summary of their progress on keeping up 
                    with these habits. Our app would synthesize the daily information into forms 
                    generally useful to our users; for instance into weekly/monthly charts or statistics including 
                    average time spent on any certain habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we identified a problem, the lack of an approachable habit tracker apps especially 
                    in the context of medical treatment. Our app aims to address said issue by providing a very 
                    flexible but still attractive app for housing all of your habit information. Our app 
                    will be a low stakes affair allowing people to add however much or however little 
                    information they want to everyday without penalty. Our app will support a person's existing 
                    intrinsic motivation to better themselves, and create a space for self-organization 
                    which is especially desired with an audience of patients.
