            <!--Adrian's paragraph-->
            <p>
                Being able to manage one's health can become a daunting task nowadays.
                We usually rely on hospitals and clinics to manage our health records and those
                sometimes are not shared across these different institutions. We believe that
                patients should have control over their health record, however, there is a gap
                that exists between health institutions and its patients. Yes, there are
                solutions that already exist that are provided by health institutions, however
                we have found that a common problem across these is that they are under
                utilized because they are complex, not user-friendly, and often unengaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is crucial to manage one's health, but it is difficult with the portals and
                apps that exist to maintain that self engagement and accountability
                in our own health. These lack personalization, or overall lack a good interface.
                Our proposed web app will aim to bridge this gap by offering a personalized
                experience through an initial quiz to understand user's preferences and even
                treatment needs, along with features that will allow for the categorization of
                their habits in a user-friendly manner. Users will also be able to journal
                and their experiences. All of this seeks to make a significant difference in the
                lives of those striving to manage their health in a more effective way.

            <!--Ava's paragraph-->
            <p>
                Currently, habit trackers online exist. For example,
                <a href="https://www.dailyhabits.xyz/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">DailyHabits</a> tracks users' habits and displays
                them in a calendar. DailyHabits displays the number of habits users have achieved
                and their habit goal. Another wellness checking option is
                <a href="https://www.mychart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyChart</a>.
                MyChart includes the ability to contact your doctor, view test results,
                and manage appointments. While myChart encompasses aspects of health and wellness,
                it doesn't necessarily support long term health goals, specifically building
                healthy habits that support certain diagnoses.

            <h2>App Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                On our app users will be interacting with their personally uploaded data about
                their habits. Our app will allow for the addition of that information
                as well as have a dashboard to access a summary of their progress on keeping up
                with these habits. Our app would synthesize the daily information into forms
                generally useful to our users; for instance into weekly/monthly charts or
                statistics including average time spent on any certain habit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally we identified a problem, the lack of an approachable habit tracker
                apps especially in the context of medical treatment. Our app aims to address
                said issue by providing a very flexible but still attractive app for housing
                all of your habit information. Our app will be a low stakes affair allowing
                people to add however much or however little information they want to everyday
                without penalty. Our app will support a person's existing intrinsic motivation
                to better themselves, and create a space for self-organization which is
                especially desired with an audience of patients.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>Our ideal audience of this application is patients who are looking to implement
                 a daily routine to improve/maintain their health diagnosis.
                Based on their assigned treatment plan, this web app allows users
                to create a standardized daily schedule. Users have access to certain
                features that help them align themselves to the goals they have set. </p>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introductory Quiz: Users start off with a quiz to collect information
                        on their preferences, frequency of treatment steps, and what they'd
                        like out of their experience. This generates a sample daily checklist.</li>
                    <li>Organize Daily Checklist: Users will have the ability to organize their
                        daily checklist, through features like grouping by category/week
                        and adding more habits to certain days. </li>
                    <li>Progress Inputting: Allows users to input their progress
                        throughout the day for each task.</li>
                    <li>Daily/Weekly Reflection: Fill out an optional daily/weekly
                        journaling section that allows them to reflect on their progress
                        and note down any important thoughts.  </li>
                    </ul>
            </section>
            <p>Overall, these features allow users to input, edit and keep track of their habits to
                keep them on top of their treatment plans.
